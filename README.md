# Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Map
## 1-Dimensional topography of self-organizing map
###### Basic implementation in Python
This project contains a code for a basic unsupervised network for clustering. The code according to Kohonen algorithm.
There are several options for data type that can be given - points that are distributed in a uniform and uneven distribution, around a certain point or in a range restriction. This is to see how things affect the form of the network.
